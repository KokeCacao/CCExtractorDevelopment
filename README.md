Here is the instruction on how to use the program:
1. Put sentences in input.txt
2. Run the command `python HMM_viterbi_word_segmentor.py`
3. You should get the output in the command prompt.

### Potential Issues (TODO)
 - The output is in command prompt. Handeling large amount of text may be problematic
 - The program is not compatible with unix system (Tested on Ubantu 14.4). If you want to run it in Windows, change the input *_unix.p files to *.p files in the program.
